"""
Running the jobs of a design study several at a time.

A SimulationIterator evaluates the graph once per design point, each in its
own job_N directory. With max_workers > 1 those jobs run at the same time,
one process each: solve_parallel takes a batch of design points and returns
one result dict per point, in the order they were given.

The 'solver' here is a stand-in that sleeps, so the example runs anywhere,
with no solver installed. In a real study it would be a DynaAnalysis,
RadiossAnalysis or OpenFOAMAnalysis, and the design points would be
thicknesses, material parameters, or whatever is being varied.

Run it in a terminal to see the tqdm job bar (pip install simnexus[progress]).
It writes its results into Study_1/ and Study_3/ in the current directory;
clean_start=True means a re-run starts from empty ones.
