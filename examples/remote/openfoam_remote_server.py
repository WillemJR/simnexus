"""
OpenFOAM gRPC server — runs inside the Docker container.

The server registers a WorkFlow containing OpenFOAMAnalysis (blockMesh + icoFoam)
and OpenFOAM_Field (pressure extraction at t=0.5).  The client sends the case
directories (system/, constant/, 0/) via copy_paths, which are written to an
isolated temp directory before solve() is called.

Start via the Dockerfile CMD; see Dockerfile.openfoam.
