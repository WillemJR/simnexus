Running in parallel
===================

The solvers are where the time goes, and a workflow can run more than one
of them at a time at three levels, which combine:

* **The solvers used in a graph** — a graph that runs several solvers
  (a structural and a fluid analysis, the same model in two solvers,
  several load cases) runs them at the same time when the
  ``DirectedGraph`` that holds them is given ``asynch=True``.
* **The jobs of a design study** — a ``SimulationIterator`` with
  ``max_workers`` > 1 evaluates several design points at once, each in its
  own job directory.
* **Other machines** — a sub-graph wrapped in a ``RemoteAction`` runs on
  a server and its results come back into the local graph; see
  :doc:`remote`.

The first two are the subject of this chapter.  Both start ordinary
child processes on the local machine, and the section at the end,
:ref:`start-methods`, describes what those processes need from your
script — on Linux nothing; on Windows that the graph be picklable.

Which one to reach for follows from what is independent.  Solvers used
in the same graph belong in an ``asynch`` graph.  The jobs of a design
study belong to ``max_workers``.  A study whose graph uses several solvers
can use both, at the price of the cores it then needs: every job is a
whole graph, an ``asynch`` graph adds a process per solver inside each
job, and a solver may itself use several cores.


Solvers used in a graph: ``asynch``
-----------------------------------

A design is often evaluated by more than one solver run — OpenRadioss and
LS-DYNA on the same model, a structural analysis alongside a CFD one, the
same deck under several load cases — and those runs do not depend on one
another, only the step that combines their results does.  Run sequentially
they take the sum of their times; ``DirectedGraph(name, asynch=True)``
starts each of them in a child process as soon as its inputs are ready, so
the design takes about as long as its slowest solver.  The dependencies
are unchanged: an action still waits for the actions it was added with as
``parents``, so the solvers overlap and the step that merges their results
runs when all of them have finished.

.. code-block:: python

    from simnexus.graph_actions import DirectedGraph, WorkFlow, WorkArea
    from simnexus.actions import MathEvaluation

    dg = DirectedGraph('TwoSolvers', asynch=True)

    # The two solvers, each running in a directory of its own. radioss_flow
    # and dyna_flow are WorkFlows: the solver action followed by the
    # action that reads its results.
    rr = dg.add_action(WorkArea(radioss_flow, copy_paths=['spring.rad']))
    rs = dg.add_action(WorkArea(dyna_flow,    copy_paths=['spring.k']))

    # Combines their results, so it runs when both solvers have finished.
    dg.add_action(MathEvaluation('solver_diff', 'rad_n5 - dyna_n5'),
                  parents=[rr, rs])

    out = dg.solve({'K': 100.0})

Leave ``asynch`` out and the same graph runs the solvers one after the
other, with the same results.  Four things follow from the solvers running
in separate processes:

**Each solver needs its own directory.**  The children inherit the
graph's working directory and would all run in it, so each solver — with
the actions that read its output — is wrapped in a ``WorkArea``, as above,
or the solvers overwrite one another's decks and results.  An action that
only computes (a ``MathEvaluation``) needs none.

**The flag is not inherited.**  ``asynch`` governs the immediate children
of the graph it is given to.  A graph nested inside an ``asynch`` graph —
the ``radioss_flow`` inside its work area, say — runs its own actions one
after the other, which is what you want there: the reader of the results
has to wait for the solver anyway.  And a ``SimulationIterator`` around an
``asynch`` graph still evaluates its designs one at a time unless it is
given ``max_workers`` (next section).

**Results cross a process boundary.**  What each solver's work area
produces comes back through a ``multiprocessing.Manager`` dict, so it must
be picklable — numbers, arrays, lists and dicts of those are; an open file
handle is not.  The results are structured exactly as in a sequential run:
a ``WorkArea`` contributes its outputs as a nested dictionary under its
own name, which is what keeps two solvers with similar action names apart.

**A solver that fails stops the others.**  If a child raises, dies or
returns nothing — a solver that terminates with an error raises
``SolverError`` in its child — the graph marks it ``failed`` in
``status.json``, terminates the solvers still running (marked ``failed``
too, with a *terminated: a sibling action failed* message) and raises
``AsyncActionError`` carrying the child's traceback.

The progress of an ``asynch`` graph is reported like any other graph's:
each child writes what it knows about its own action to a sidecar file
that the graph merges into its ``status.json``, so each solver's
percent-complete shows up there while it runs, next to the others.


Design study jobs: ``max_workers``
----------------------------------

``SimulationIterator(graph, max_workers=N)`` evaluates up to ``N`` design
points at the same time, each in a child process with its own job
directory:

.. code-block:: python

    itr = SimulationIterator(wf, copy_paths=['path/to/spring.k'], max_workers=4)
    pars, out = itr.collect_for_varrange({'K': [100., 200., 300., 400., 500.]})

The results are the same as with the default ``max_workers=1``, and come
back in the order the design points were given.  Only the sweep methods
(``collect_for_varrange``, ``collect_for_expdes`` and ``solve_parallel``,
which takes an explicit list of design points) fan out; ``solve`` is a
single design point and always runs in the calling process.

Job directories are numbered by the calling process alone, so the jobs
cannot collide over a number, and each job leaves its results in its own
directory as usual — ``results_for``, ``collect`` and ``reuse_existing``
(see :doc:`dirs`) see no difference between a job that ran in a child
and one that ran in the calling process.

A job that fails aborts the sweep, as it does when the jobs run one after
the other: the jobs still running are terminated, marked ``failed`` in the
index, and ``AsyncActionError`` is raised with the failing job's
traceback.  The jobs that completed before it keep their results, so the
sweep can be resumed with ``reuse_existing=True``.

Choose ``max_workers`` for what the machine can actually run: every job is
a full graph, a solver action may use several cores of its own, and an
``asynch`` graph adds processes inside each job.  A sweep of six two-second
jobs with ``max_workers=3`` is what ``examples/parallel_jobs.py`` runs; it
needs no solver installed.


Watching the jobs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In a terminal the batch reports itself as ``tqdm`` bars: one counting the
jobs of the batch, and under it a bar per job running right now::

    Study_Iter:  50%|█████████████            | 3/6 [00:42<00:41, 13.9s/job]
      job_3  rad 1 of 3: time 12.9 of 40 (97%)        32%|███████▎               |
      job_4  rad 1 of 3: time 11.4 of 40 (86%)        28%|██████▍                |
      job_5  rad 1 of 3: time  2.1 of 40 (16%)         5%|█▏                     |

A job's bar is fed from the ``status.json`` that job writes, so it follows
the job through its actions and shows a solver's percent-complete while one
runs (:func:`simnexus.progress.job_fraction` is what turns those action
states into the one number the bar needs). An action of your own reports
itself the same way, by calling ``self.report_progress(fraction, message)``
inside ``solve``.

A job's line names the action running now and its place in the graph
(``rad 1 of 3``), then that action's own message and percentage. The bar's
own percentage is something else: the whole job, averaged over its actions
-- a solver 97% through the first of three actions leaves the job at 32%.

The bars appear when tqdm is installed (``pip install simnexus[progress]``)
and stderr is a terminal, so they never litter a log file; pass
``progress_bar=True``/``False`` to ``solve_parallel``,
``collect_for_expdes`` or ``collect_for_varrange`` to decide explicitly.
They are a convenience for watching a run go by — the ``status.json`` files
are written either way.

So that the bars keep their lines, a job running in parallel does not write
to the terminal: its stdout and stderr (the solver wrappers' messages, its
log records) are redirected into ``job_N/job.log``, which cleanup never
removes. A job run serially still writes to the terminal, where there are
no bars to disturb.

Each job writes its own ``status.json``, and the root ``status.json``
lists the jobs running at that moment in ``current_jobs``, so
:func:`simnexus.progress.watch_run` — or a GUI polling the results tree
with :class:`simnexus.progress.RunWatcher` — shows all of them at once,
from another process if need be.


.. _start-methods:

Child processes and start methods
---------------------------------

The two places simnexus runs work in another process — a sweep with
``max_workers`` > 1, and an ``asynch`` graph — start their children with
``fork`` where the platform has it and with ``spawn`` where it does not,
which on Windows is always.  ``simnexus.util.parallel.get_context`` makes
the choice.

Under ``fork`` the child is a copy of the calling process and inherits
everything: the graph, the imports, the logging configuration, the working
directory.  Under ``spawn`` the child is a *fresh interpreter*, and the
graph and its actions travel to it as a pickle.  That asks one thing of the
caller: **keep the graph picklable, without the script.**  Define your
action classes in a module the child can import — any ``.py`` file on
``sys.path`` — not in the script that starts the run and not inside a
function, and keep open files, sockets and database handles out of an
action's attributes; build them in ``solve`` instead.  simnexus' own
unpicklable state (progress locks, heartbeat threads, live child processes)
is dropped and rebuilt for you.

The script itself is not re-imported by the children (they need nothing
from it), so it runs once, as written::

    from simnexus.graph_actions import WorkFlow, SimulationIterator
    from my_actions import Mesh, Solve       # an importable module

    wf = WorkFlow('Study', actions=[Mesh('mesh'), Solve('run')])
    itr = SimulationIterator(wf, max_workers=4)
    pars, out = itr.collect_for_varrange({'K': [100., 200., 300.]})

Had ``Mesh`` been defined in this script instead, the child could not find
it, and simnexus refuses the start with a ``SpawnError`` naming the class
rather than letting the child die on it.  Move the class into a module;
or set ``SIMNEXUS_SPAWN_IMPORTS_MAIN=1`` to have every child re-import the
script as stock multiprocessing does, in which case the script must not
start the run at top level.

Everything else is the same on both start methods: the job directories, the
``status.json`` files, the ``job.log`` redirect, the progress bars, the
index and the failure semantics.  Spawning is a little slower to start each
job, which matters only for jobs that are themselves quick.

Set ``SIMNEXUS_START_METHOD=spawn`` to use the Windows path on Linux — to
reproduce a Windows problem, or in a process that has already started
threads and must not fork.
