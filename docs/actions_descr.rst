A graph of actions
==================
All the steps in a simulation are encapsulated in actions.
The basic action types can be a change to an input deck, running an OpenFOAM analysis, or
extracting results from an analysis.

Some actions are used for control e.g. to set up the simulation as a graph where some actions depend on other actions.

The diagram below illustrates a workflow where a single geometry creation step leads to two parallel analysis branches: one for OpenRadioss and another for LS-DYNA. Each branch includes meshing and parameterization steps, and finally, the results from both solvers are combined to compute the overall design performance.

Using an action
---------------
An action defines an operation in the workflow.
It can be anything from a geometry creation, an FEA analysis, 
to mathematical computations.
Once you have an action defined, you can call the 'solve()' method
to execute.

The return value of the 'solve()' method depends on the action; for example,
for a d3plot database extraction it may return the extracted data
as a numpy array.

You can call the 'solve()' method on a graph. In which case it will return a dictionary
containing the names and return values of all the children;
e.g. ``{'child_A': array([2, 1, 2]), 'child_B': 3.1}``.
A child that is itself a graph — a sub-graph, a ``WorkArea``, or a
``d3plot_File``, which is a workflow of extractions — contributes its own
dictionary under its name rather than merging its results into the
parent's, so its values are reached as ``ret['child_graph']['value']``.

.. code-block:: python

        from simnexus.dyna_actions import DynaAnalysis
        dyna = DynaAnalysis(name="RunSpring", input_path="spring.k")
        ret = dyna.solve( {'K': 100.} )

You can chain actions to edit a mesh or extract results as described below.


Defining a user action
-------------------------
You can create your own action by subclassing WorkAction
and defining the action in the 'solve()' method.
The optional ``description`` argument documents what the action returns.
If omitted, the class docstring is used.

.. code-block:: python

    from simnexus.actions import WorkAction

    class AdderAction(WorkAction):
        """Adds two numbers and returns the sum."""
        def solve(self, val_dict=None):
            a = val_dict.get('a', 0)
            b = val_dict.get('b', 0)
            return a + b

    # With an explicit description:
    adder = AdderAction(name='add', description='Sum of inputs a and b')




Setting up a graph
------------------
Two types of graphs are available:
firstly, a WorkFlow, a simple version executing the actions sequentially;
and a DirectedGraph, which allows execution to branch and execute
actions in parallel.

To use a WorkFlow to evaluate actions sequentially:

.. code-block:: python

    from simnexus.d3plot_actions import d3plot_File
    from simnexus.dyna_actions import DynaAnalysis
    from simnexus.graph_actions import WorkFlow

    wf = WorkFlow(name="SpringWorkFlow")
    wf.add_action( DynaAnalysis(name="RunSpring", input_path="spring.k") )
    d3p = d3plot_File( name='d3p' )
    d3p.NodalValue(name='n5', state=1, nid=5, component= 'node_displacement'  )
    wf.add_action( d3p )

    ret = wf.solve( {'K': 100.} )

    # 'd3p' is itself a graph, so its extractions sit under its name
    print( 'Displacement of node 5', ret['d3p']['n5'] )

To use a DirectedGraph.  The example below runs the same spring deck
through two solvers and compares the answers — an OpenRadioss branch and
an LS-DYNA branch that execute independently, and a merge action that
waits for both:

.. code-block:: python

    from simnexus.actions import MathEvaluation
    from simnexus.d3plot_actions import d3plot_File
    from simnexus.dyna_actions import DynaAnalysis
    from simnexus.graph_actions import DirectedGraph, WorkFlow, WorkArea
    from simnexus.radioss_using_dyna_inp import RadiossUsingDynaInput

    dg = DirectedGraph( name='MDO', asynch=True )

    # OpenRadioss branch: the LS-DYNA deck run by OpenRadioss
    rad_wf = WorkFlow( name='RadiossBranch' )
    rad_wf.add_action( RadiossUsingDynaInput( name='rad',
                                              cmd='rad_dyna_inp',
                                              input_path='spring.k',
                                              create_d3plot=True ) )
    rad_d3p = d3plot_File( name='d3p' )
    rad_d3p.NodalValue( name='rad_n5', state=1, nid=5, component='node_displacement' )
    rad_wf.add_action( rad_d3p )

    rr = dg.add_action( WorkArea( rad_wf, copy_paths=['path/to/spring.k'] ) )

    # LS-DYNA branch
    dyna_wf = WorkFlow( name='DynaBranch' )
    dyna_wf.add_action( DynaAnalysis( name='RunSpring', input_path='spring.k' ) )
    dyna_d3p = d3plot_File( name='dyna_field' )
    dyna_d3p.NodalValue( name='dyna_n5', state=1, nid=5, component='node_displacement' )
    dyna_wf.add_action( dyna_d3p )

    rs = dg.add_action( WorkArea( dyna_wf, copy_paths=['path/to/spring.k'] ) )

    # Merge back: runs once both branches have finished
    dg.add_action( MathEvaluation( name='solver_diff',
                                   cmd='abs( rad_n5 - dyna_n5 )' ),
                   parents=[ rr, rs ] )

    ret = dg.solve( {'K': 100.} )

    print( 'Solver difference at node 5', ret['solver_diff'] )

Three things in that example are worth spelling out.

**Each branch gets its own directory.**  Both solvers write a ``d3plot``
file, and both would write it into the current directory, so each branch
is wrapped in a ``WorkArea``.  ``add_action`` returns the action it was
given, so the returned work areas are what the merge action names as its
parents.  See :doc:`dirs`.

**Results stay structured.**  A ``WorkArea`` contributes its outputs as a
nested dictionary under its own name, and so does the ``d3plot_File``
inside it — which is what keeps two branches with similar action names
apart.  Each level also carries the values that were passed into it::

    { 'K': 100.0,
      'RadiossBranch_WorkArea': {
          'K': 100.0,
          'rad': True,                     # the solver reported normal termination
          'd3p': { 'K': 100.0, 'rad': True,
                         'rad_n5': array([40.127, 0., 0.]) } },
      'DynaBranch_WorkArea': {
          'K': 100.0,
          'RunSpring': True,
          'dyna_field': { 'K': 100.0, 'RunSpring': True,
                          'dyna_n5': array([40.127, 0., 0.]) } },
      'solver_diff': array([0., 0., 0.]) }

A ``MathEvaluation`` flattens this view before evaluating, so its
expression refers to ``rad_n5`` and ``dyna_n5`` directly, without naming
the work area or the d3plot reader they sit in.  Note that
``node_displacement`` is a three-component vector, so ``solver_diff`` is
an array rather than a single number.

**Branches can run at the same time.**  ``asynch=True`` evaluates
independent actions — here the two work areas — in separate processes.
The merge action still waits for both, because it was added with
``parents=[rr, rs]``.  Leave ``asynch`` out to run the same graph
sequentially.

Call ``dg.describe_workflow()`` to print the action tree and the
directory structure the run will create, without running anything or
having the solvers installed.
