Running a graph in different directories
========================================

Creating directories and copying files
---------------------------------------

Solver actions such as ``DynaAnalysis``, ``RadiossAnalysis``, and
``OpenFOAMAnalysis`` expect their input files to be present in the
current working directory when they run.  Two classes handle directory
creation and file copying automatically: ``WorkArea`` and
``SimulationIterator``.

``copy_paths`` is always specified on ``WorkArea`` or
``SimulationIterator`` — not on individual solver actions.


WorkArea
--------

``WorkArea`` evaluates a graph in a dedicated directory.
Each call to ``solve()`` cleans the directory and re-copies the required
files, so previous results are overwritten.  This is the right choice
for a single run or when you want to inspect intermediate files after
the run.

.. code-block:: python

    from simnexus.graph_actions import WorkFlow, WorkArea
    from simnexus.dyna_actions import DynaAnalysis
    from simnexus.d3plot_actions import d3plot_File

    wf = WorkFlow('SpringWorkFlow')
    wf.add_action(DynaAnalysis(name='run', input_path='spring.k'))
    wf.add_action(d3plot_File(name='field'))

    # 'spring.k' is copied from its source location into ./SpringWorkFlow/
    # before the graph runs.
    wa = WorkArea(wf, copy_paths=['path/to/spring.k'])
    results = wa.solve({'K': 200.0})

By default the work directory is ``./{graph.name}`` — created relative to
the current directory at run time (not the directory in which the
``WorkArea`` was constructed). This means a ``WorkArea`` can be nested
inside a ``SimulationIterator``: it is created *inside* the current
``job_N`` directory rather than next to it. A custom path can be supplied
as the second argument::

    wa = WorkArea(wf, work_area_path='~/runs/spring', copy_paths=['path/to/spring.k'])

An explicit relative path is likewise resolved against the current
directory at run time, while an absolute path is used as given. The
directory path may contain ``~`` and environment variables; both are
expanded automatically.


SimulationIterator
------------------

``SimulationIterator`` evaluates a graph once per design point, placing
each run in its own numbered subdirectory (``job_0``, ``job_1``, …).
The required files are copied into each job directory before the graph
runs.  Use this when you need to keep the results from every run, for
example during a parameter study or optimisation.

.. code-block:: python

    from simnexus.graph_actions import WorkFlow, SimulationIterator
    from simnexus.dyna_actions import DynaAnalysis
    from simnexus.d3plot_actions import d3plot_File

    wf = WorkFlow('SpringWorkFlow')
    wf.add_action(DynaAnalysis(name='run', input_path='spring.k'))
    wf.add_action(d3plot_File(name='field'))

    itr = SimulationIterator(wf, copy_paths=['path/to/spring.k'])

    # Each call to solve() creates a new job_N subdirectory.
    itr.solve({'K': 100.0})   # writes to SpringWorkFlow/job_0/
    itr.solve({'K': 200.0})   # writes to SpringWorkFlow/job_1/

The resulting directory layout is::

    SpringWorkFlow/
    ├── jobs_index.json
    ├── status.json                 # run progress; see simnexus.progress
    ├── variables_discovery/        # copies used to read the deck's variables
    ├── job_0/
    │   ├── iter_variables.json
    │   ├── actions_output.pkl
    │   ├── status.json             # per-action progress for this job
    │   └── ...                     # the deck, the solver's output files
    ├── job_1/
    │   ├── iter_variables.json
    │   └── actions_output.pkl

``variables_discovery`` appears when the iterator has to discover the
variables itself: ``parameters()`` copies ``copy_paths`` there and reads
the deck.  Passing ``parameter_list`` explicitly skips it.

An existing results directory is added to.  Job numbers continue after
whatever is already there — taken from the index and the directories on
disk, not from a counter on the iterator — so a study can be extended in
a later session and a finished job is never written over:

.. code-block:: python

    itr = SimulationIterator(wf, copy_paths=['path/to/spring.k'])
    itr.solve({'K': 300.0})    # a later session: writes job_2, not job_0

Pass ``clean_start=True`` to delete the results directory (jobs, index
and all) before starting::

    itr = SimulationIterator(wf, copy_paths=['path/to/spring.k'], clean_start=True)

The job directories are named ``job_0 … job_N``; the prefix comes from
the class attribute ``SimulationIterator.JNAME`` and can be changed if
another name suits better — on the instance, or in a subclass when a
whole family of studies uses it::

    itr = SimulationIterator(wf, copy_paths=['path/to/spring.k'])
    itr.JNAME = 'design_'
    itr.solve({'K': 100.0})    # writes to SpringWorkFlow/design_0/

    class DesignIterator(SimulationIterator):
        JNAME = 'design_'

Change the prefix on an empty results directory.  Jobs already written
under the old prefix stay in the index and can still be read back by
variable value, but they no longer take part in the numbering, so the new
prefix starts its own series at ``0``.

Variable values are *not* encoded in the directory name — they are
recorded in ``jobs_index.json``, which is what the retrieval methods
below use.




Cleaning up bulk solver output
------------------------------

It is easy to fill up a disk by keeping all the solver output in every job directory.
The solver output being the plot databases, the OpenRadioss animation files, the converted VTK, etc.
Pass a ``Cleanup`` policy to have them removed once a run has finished:

.. code-block:: python

    from simnexus import Cleanup

    itr = SimulationIterator(wf, copy_paths=['path/to/spring.k'],
                             cleanup=Cleanup(keep=['d3plot']))

Each job is cleaned as soon as its graph has run to the end — not
before, so a ``d3plot_File`` action downstream of the solver has already
read what it needed. A job that failed is not cleaned, leaving you the deck and
solver log to you debug it with.  ``cleanup=True`` selects the
default policy; the default, ``None``, keeps everything as before.

**What may be removed.** The actions declare their own bulk output, so a
policy normally names no files at all:

``Cleanup(remove='bulk')``
    The default.  The field output the actions declare as disposable:
    ``d3plot*``, ``d3thdt*``, ``d3dump*``, ``runrsf*``, ``binout*`` for
    LS-DYNA; the animation and restart files (plus the d3plot and VTK
    conversions, when those are enabled) for OpenRadioss; ``VTK/`` and
    ``processor*`` for OpenFOAM.  Input decks, solver logs and small
    time-history files are never in this set — they are what a finished
    run is read back with.

``Cleanup(remove=['*.vtk', 'd3plot0*'])``
    Exactly those patterns, in every run directory, instead of the
    declared set.

``Cleanup(remove=Cleanup.ALL)``
    Everything except the protected files and ``keep``.  A job directory
    also holds files nothing declared — copied-in inputs, solver scratch —
    so this deletes more than simnexus knows about.  Use it deliberately,
    and once with ``dry_run=True`` first.

**What you keep.** ``keep`` is a list of glob patterns that always wins
over ``remove``, so you subtract from the declared set rather than
enumerating what to delete::

    Cleanup(keep=['d3plot'])      # drop the state files, keep the first plot

The same argument exists on the solver actions themselves, next to the
knowledge of what those files are.  The action only *declares* it; the
work area still decides when to delete::

    DynaAnalysis(name='run', input_path='spring.k', keep=['d3plot', 'binout*'])

**What is never deleted.** ``actions_output.pkl``, ``iter_variables.json``,
``jobs_index.json`` and ``status.json``, whatever the patterns match.  A
cleaned study is still a study: ``results_for``, ``collect``,
``find_jobs`` and ``reuse_existing`` all keep working, since they read
the stored outputs and the index rather than the solver files.

**WorkArea.** The same argument works there, and is inherited by a work
area nested inside a ``SimulationIterator`` unless that work area sets its
own policy::

    inner = WorkArea(wf, cleanup=Cleanup(keep=['d3plot*']))   # overrides
    itr   = SimulationIterator(outer_graph, cleanup=True)

Note that a ``WorkArea`` empties its directory at the *start* of every
run in any case; ``cleanup`` is about what the last run leaves behind,
and about work areas nested in a study.

**Checking first.** ``Cleanup(dry_run=True)`` logs what it would remove
and removes nothing.  ``print_work_dir()`` marks the affected files, so
the predicted directory structure stays honest about what survives::

    itr.print_work_dir()

    SpringWorkFlow/   (results root)
    ├── status.json   (run progress: current job, jobs done; ...)
    ├── jobs_index.json   (job -> variable values and group labels; ...)
    ├── job_0/   (one directory per design evaluation)
    │   ├── iter_variables.json   (this design's variable values)
    │   ├── actions_output.pkl   (this design's action outputs)
    │   ├── dyna_variables.json
    │   ├── dyna_action_inp.k
    │   ├── run_file.stdout
    │   ├── run_file.stderr
    │   ├── d3plot*   (removed by cleanup)
    │   └── d3hsp
    └── job_1/ … job_N/

The mark is per pattern, not per file: with ``keep=['d3plot']`` the
``d3plot*`` line is marked even though the first plot survives.



Retrieving and grouping past runs
---------------------------------

``jobs_index.json`` at the results root maps each job directory to the
variable values it was run with, its state, and any group labels::

    { "jobs": [ { "job": "job_0",
                  "groups": [ "baseline" ],
                  "variables": { "K": 100.0 },
                  "state": "done",
                  "created_at": 1753.0, "updated_at": 1755.0 } ] }

**Retrieving results without running the graph.**  Point a new
``SimulationIterator`` at an existing results directory and ask it for
results by variable value.  Nothing is executed:

.. code-block:: python

    itr = SimulationIterator(wf, work_area_path='SpringWorkFlow')

    out  = itr.results_for({'K': 100.0})    # the stored actions_output.pkl
    path = itr.find_job(where={'K': 100.0}) # SpringWorkFlow/job_0

``results_for`` prefers the job whose variables are exactly the ones
given, and otherwise accepts an unambiguous partial match, so
``results_for({'K': 100.0})`` works in a study that also varied ``T``
as long as only one job has that ``K``.  It raises ``DataNotFoundError``
when no job matches and when several do.

**Grouping runs.**  A job may carry any number of group labels.  Set a
default for the iterator, per sweep, or per job — the most specific wins:

.. code-block:: python

    itr = SimulationIterator(wf, groups='baseline')       # default for all jobs
    itr.collect_for_varrange({'K': [100., 200.]})         # -> 'baseline'
    itr.collect_for_varrange({'K': [300.]}, groups='stiff')
    itr.solve({'K': 400.}, groups=['stiff', 'hand_check'])
    itr.groups = 'later_runs'                             # from here on

Because the labels are metadata rather than directories, runs can be
grouped long after they finished, and one job can belong to several
groups:

.. code-block:: python

    itr.add_groups('converged', where={'K': 100.0})
    itr.add_groups('report', jobs=['job_0', 'job_3'])
    itr.remove_groups('stiff', jobs=['job_2'])
    itr.group_names()                    # ['baseline', 'converged', ...]

Read a group back in the same form a sweep returns — so grouped runs can
be plotted or post-processed like a fresh study:

.. code-block:: python

    pars, out = itr.collect(groups='baseline')
    # pars: {'K': array([100., 200.])}, out: {'disp': [...], ...}

    pars, out = itr.collect(groups=['baseline', 'converged'],
                            match_all_groups=True)   # in both groups
    jobs = itr.find_jobs(groups='report', state=None)

**Reusing completed runs.**  With ``reuse_existing=True`` a design point
that already has a completed job is not run again — its stored outputs
are returned and its labels extended, while new design points run as
usual:

.. code-block:: python

    itr = SimulationIterator(wf, work_area_path='SpringWorkFlow',
                             reuse_existing=True, groups='study_2')
    pars, out = itr.collect_for_varrange({'K': [100., 500.]})
    itr.reused_jobs        # ['job_0']  — K=100 came off disk

The flag only decides whether computed design points are skipped; adding
to an existing results directory needs no flag.  Without it every design
point given is run, appended after the jobs already there — so the same
values can appear in several jobs, which is what you want when a deck or
a solver version changed.  Note that reuse matches on the *complete* set
of variable values, so a job that differs in any variable is treated as a
different design point.

**Running several jobs at once.**  ``max_workers`` evaluates that many
design points at the same time, each in a forked process with its own job
directory:

.. code-block:: python

    itr = SimulationIterator(wf, copy_paths=['path/to/spring.k'], max_workers=4)
    pars, out = itr.collect_for_varrange({'K': [100., 200., 300., 400., 500.]})

The results are the same as with the default ``max_workers=1``, and come
back in the order the design points were given.  Only the sweep methods
(``collect_for_varrange``, ``collect_for_expdes``) fan out; ``solve`` is a
single design point and always runs in the calling process.

In a terminal the batch reports itself as ``tqdm`` bars: one counting the
jobs of the batch, and under it a bar per job running right now::

    Study_Iter:  50%|█████████████            | 3/6 [00:42<00:41, 13.9s/job]
      job_3  rad 1 of 3: time 12.9 of 40 (97%)        32%|███████▎               |
      job_4  rad 1 of 3: time 11.4 of 40 (86%)        28%|██████▍                |
      job_5  rad 1 of 3: time  2.1 of 40 (16%)         5%|█▏                     |

A job's bar is fed from the ``status.json`` that job writes, so it follows
the job through its actions and shows a solver's percent-complete while one
runs (:func:`simnexus.progress.job_fraction` is what turns those action
states into the one number the bar needs). An action of your own reports
itself the same way, by calling ``self.report_progress(fraction, message)``
inside ``solve``.

A job's line names the action running now and its place in the graph
(``rad 1 of 3``), then that action's own message and percentage. The bar's
own percentage is something else: the whole job, averaged over its actions
-- a solver 97% through the first of three actions leaves the job at 32%.

The bars appear when tqdm is installed (``pip install simnexus[progress]``)
and stderr is a terminal, so they never litter a log file; pass
``progress_bar=True``/``False`` to ``solve_parallel``,
``collect_for_expdes`` or ``collect_for_varrange`` to decide explicitly.
They are a convenience for watching a run go by — the ``status.json`` files
are written either way.

So that the bars keep their lines, a job running in parallel does not write
to the terminal: its stdout and stderr (the solver wrappers' messages, its
log records) are redirected into ``job_N/job.log``, which cleanup never
removes. A job run serially still writes to the terminal, where there are
no bars to disturb.

Job directories are numbered by the calling process alone, so the jobs
cannot collide over a number, and each job leaves its results in its own
directory as usual — ``results_for``, ``collect`` and ``reuse_existing``
see no difference.  Each job writes its own ``status.json``, and the root
``status.json`` lists the jobs running at that moment in ``current_jobs``,
so :func:`simnexus.progress.watch_run` shows all of them at once.

A job that fails aborts the sweep, as it does when the jobs run one after
the other: the jobs still running are terminated, marked ``failed`` in the
index, and ``AsyncActionError`` is raised with the failing job's
traceback.  The jobs that completed before it keep their results, so the
sweep can be resumed with ``reuse_existing=True``.

Choose ``max_workers`` for what the machine can actually run: every job is
a full graph, a solver action may use several cores of its own, and an
``asynch`` graph adds processes inside each job.

The index is a cache, never the authority.  ``itr.job_index(rebuild=True)``
re-derives it by reading the job directories, so result trees created
before the index existed keep working; only the group labels — which
exist nowhere else — are lost if the file is deleted.
