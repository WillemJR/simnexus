# SimNexus

A Python module for orchestrating complex simulations 
with native support for LS-DYNA, OpenRadioss, and OpenFOAM.

## Overview

`SimNexus` enables the automation and coordination of
multi-physics simulation workflows.
The module is particularly suited for simulations that span multiple domains, such as combined structural and fluid dynamics analyses.
It supports tasks from from input preparation and
remote execution to results extraction and post-processing.

A design variant is defined using variables 
and evaluated using a directed graph of actions.
The design variables can be user defined or defined
inside the input decks of the supported solvers using e.g. a \*PARAMETER keyword.
An action is any processing step such as mesh creation, an FEA simulation,
results extraction, or computations; while
the graph specifies the dependencies between actions.
An action therefore waits for the other actions it depends on.

Multiple designs can be evaluated in parallel. 
A simulation iterator evaluates the whole graph for several design points simultaneously, each in its own job directory.
Within a single graph, independent branches can likewise run at the same time,
each in its own process.


`SimNexus` has a native support for solvers like LS-DYNA, OpenRadioss, and OpenFOAM. In addition OpenRadioss using LS-DYNA input is supported as a special case.

## Key Features

- **Workflow Management**: Define simulation workflows as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) where actions are executed based on dependency relationships and completion status of prerequisite tasks
- **Native Solver Support**: Specify input parameter values and the results to extract for a supported solver.  Currently implemented are LS-DYNA and OpenRadioss for structural analysis, and OpenFOAM for computational fluid dynamics
- **Results Extraction**: Read from the solvers' result databases in the graph. Supported are: LS-DYNA d3plot, OpenRadioss VTK and time-history CSV, and OpenFOAM fields and histories.
- **Parallel Execution**: Evaluate several design points of a study concurrently, each job in its own directory with its own progress bar; within one graph, independent branches run at the same time
- **Remote Execution**: Submit computational subgraphs to remote computing resources while maintaining local workflow coordination
- **Custom Actions**: Add an operation of your own by subclassing `WorkAction` and writing `solve(val_dict)`; it then behaves like any built-in action.
- **Discoverability**: Query any graph for its inputs and outputs without running it — solver actions read their parameterised input files to report variable names, types, and default values

## Typical Workflow

The user usually need to:

1. Parameterize input files for target solvers
2. Define the actions and their dependencies

The typical `simnexus` steps are:

1. Update parameter values with the values for the current design
2. Execute simulations on designated compute resources (local or remote), possibly in parallel
3. Extract relevant results from solver outputs
4. Aggregate, summarize, and postprocess findings 



## Documentation

[Online documentation is available here](https://willemjr.github.io/simnexus/)



## Installation

```bash
pip install simnexus[remote,dyna,progress,dev]
```

SimNexus has so far only been tested on Linux and WSL.
Windows testing is not yet complete; use WSL.

The library uses lasso-python (including vortex-radioss and lasso.dyna) as
well as dynakw for compatibility with LS-DYNA,
and grpc for remote execution.


## Usage
See also the documentation and the examples directory.

Note that OpenFOAM, LS-DYNA and OpenRadioss workflows follow the same pattern.

### OpenRadioss
An example for OpenRadioss is given below.
An example using LS-DYNA input is given the examples directory.

```
starter_deck = Path('models/cube_TYPE7_0000.rad')
engine_deck  = Path('models/cube_TYPE7_0001.rad')

# 1. Define RadiossAnalysis to run the simulation
run_rad = RadiossAnalysis( name='rad', 
                  starter_cmd='openradioss_starter',
                  starter_input_path=starter_deck,
                  engine_cmd='openradioss_engine',
                  engine_input_path=engine_deck,
                  create_d3plot=True )

# 2. Create a workflow and add the d3plot extraction actions
wf = WorkFlow( 'Radioss_WorkFlow' )
wf.add_action( run_rad )

d3p = d3plot_File( name='d3plot' )
d3p.NodalValue(name='n5', state=1, nid=5, component= 'node_displacement'  )
wf.add_action( d3p )

wrk_area = WorkArea( wf, copy_paths=[starter_deck,engine_deck] )

# Discover variables defined in input deck and other actions
discovered_vars = wrk_area.parameters()
print("Discovered variables:")
for v in discovered_vars:
        print(f"  {v}")

# 3. Execute the workflow. Provide values for the variables.
val_dict = { 'E': 210000.0, }

print("Starting workflow...")
print(f"Parameters: {val_dict}")
    
ret = wrk_area.solve( val_dict )
print("Available results.", ret.keys() )

```

### OpenFOAM
An example for OpenFOAM is given below.

```
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.WARNING)

from pathlib import Path
from simnexus.args import JobType
from simnexus.graph_actions import WorkFlow, WorkArea
from simnexus.openfoam_actions import OpenFOAMAnalysis
from simnexus.openfoam_actions import OpenFOAM_Field, OpenFOAM_History

def create_openfoam_graph():

    case_dir = Path(__file__).parent.parent / "tests" / "openfoam_exa"
    if not case_dir.exists(): exit(f"Error: {case_dir} does not exist.")

    case_paths = [
        str(case_dir / "system"),
        str(case_dir / "constant"),
        str(case_dir / "0"),
    ]

    wf = WorkFlow('OpenFOAM_WorkFlow')

    wf.add_action( OpenFOAMAnalysis(
        name="my_job",
        job_flag=JobType.CREATE_MESH | JobType.RUN_SIMULATION,
        solve_cmd="icoFoam",
        mesh_cmd="blockMesh" ) )

    wf.add_action(  OpenFOAM_Field(  # Extract field of pressure values
        name='pressure',
        field_variable='p',
        time=0.5 ) )

    wa = WorkArea(wf, copy_paths=case_paths)

    return wa


of_graph = create_openfoam_graph()

# List graph variables and outputs
print("\n\nGraph variables:")
for v in of_graph.parameters():
        print(f" - {v}")

print("\n\nGraph outputs:")
for name, (eval_type, description) in of_graph.outputs().items():
    print(f' - {name}: {eval_type} — {description}')


# Run the job with new parameter values
print("\n\nRunning job.solve({'lidVelocity': 1.2, 'nCells': 6})...")
outcomes = of_graph.solve({"lidVelocity": 1.2, "nCells": 6})

# Print the computed field
print(f"Pressure field:", outcomes['pressure'] )
```

### Inspecting a graph

A graph can be examined before it is run — what it is made of, what it will
write to disk, what values it needs and what it will produce. Nothing here
starts a solver.

```
# using itr -- an existing graph, work area or simulation iterator

itr.print_tree()                 # the actions, as a tree
itr.print_work_dir()             # the directories and files a run will create
itr.describe_workflow()          # both of the above, one after the other
```

```
SimulationIterator 'Radioss_WorkFlow_Iter'
└── WorkFlow 'Radioss_WorkFlow'
    ├── RadiossAnalysis 'rad'
    └── d3plot_File 'd3plot'
        └── _d3plot_NodalValue 'n5'
```

Pass `describe=True` to add each action's description:

```
SimulationIterator 'Radioss_WorkFlow_Iter'  — Simulation iterator for graph Radioss_WorkFlow
└── WorkFlow 'Radioss_WorkFlow'  — Workflow Radioss_WorkFlow
    ├── RadiossAnalysis 'rad'  — OpenRadioss analysis using input file models/cube_TYPE7_0000.rad
    └── d3plot_File 'd3plot'  — D3plot file reader for d3plot
        └── _d3plot_NodalValue 'n5'  — D3plot nodal field node_displacement at state 1
```

`print_work_dir()` predicts the run directory from the actions themselves, so it
works before anything has run and without the solvers installed:

```
Radioss_WorkFlow/   (results root)
├── status.json   (run progress: current job, jobs done; see simnexus.progress)
├── jobs_index.json   (job -> variable values and group labels; see simnexus.simulation_iterator)
├── job_0/   (one directory per design evaluation)
│   ├── iter_variables.json   (this design's variable values)
│   ├── actions_output.pkl   (this design's action outputs)
│   ├── cube_TYPE7_0000.rad   (copied in)
│   ├── cube_TYPE7_0001.rad   (copied in)
│   ├── status.json   (live action states; see simnexus.progress)
│   ├── radioss_variables.json
│   ├── rad_run_file_0000.rad
│   ├── rad_run_file_0001.rad
│   ├── rad_run_file_0000.starter.stdout
│   ├── rad_run_file_0000.starter.stderr
│   ├── rad_run_file_0001.engine.stdout
│   ├── rad_run_file_0001.engine.stderr
│   └── d3plot*
└── job_1/ … job_N/
```

The inputs and the outputs are asked for in the same way. `parameters()` returns
the variables the graph needs — solver actions read them out of their
parameterised input files — and `outputs()` the results each action produces:

```
# Inputs: the variables the graph expects, with type, default and origin
for v in itr.parameters():
    print( ' -', v )

# Outputs: {action name: (data type, description)}
for name, (data_type, description) in itr.outputs().items():
    print( f' - {name}: {data_type} — {description}' )
```

```
 - Variable Name: E, Data Type: float, Value: 210000.0, Description: 'From 'cube_TYPE7_0000.rad''

 - rad: EvalType.NOT_SPECIFIED — OpenRadioss analysis using input file models/cube_TYPE7_0000.rad
 - n5: EvalType.NOT_SPECIFIED — D3plot nodal field node_displacement at state 1
```

Call `parameters()` on a `WorkArea` or `SimulationIterator` rather than on the
bare graph: they copy `copy_paths` into a temporary directory first, so the
solver actions can find the decks they have to read.

### Design studies using parallel execution

A `SimulationIterator` runs the graph once per design point, each in its own
job directory. Give it `max_workers` and `solve_parallel` evaluates a batch of
design points that many at a time, one process per job:

```
# using wf -- an existing workflow 

# Create a simulation iteration that runs four jobs at the same time,
# each in its own job_N directory. cleanup=True deletes the bulk solver
# output (here the d3plot) of a job once its graph has run, so the
# extractions below still get their data but the study does not fill the
# disk.
itr = SimulationIterator( wf, copy_paths=[starter_deck, engine_deck],
                          max_workers=4, cleanup=True )

design_points = [ { 'E': 190000. },
                  { 'E': 210000. },
                  { 'E': 230000. },
                  { 'E': 250000. } ]

# run the jobs
evals = itr.solve_parallel( design_points  )

for vals, out in zip( design_points, evals ):
    print( vals, '->', out['d3plot']['n5'] )
```

`solve_parallel` returns one result dict per design point, in the order given —
the same results a serial run produces, only faster. In a terminal it reports
itself as a bar counting the jobs of the batch, and under it one bar per job
running right now:

```
Radioss_WorkFlow_Iter:  25%|██▌       | 1/4 [00:14<00:43, 14.5s/job]
  job_1  rad 1 of 3: time 12.9 of 40 (97%)        32%|███████▎               |
  job_2  rad 1 of 3: time 11.4 of 40 (86%)        29%|██████▋                |
  job_3  d3plot 2 of 3                            67%|███████████████▍       |
```

In the above there is a progress bar for the iterator and a bar
for each of the jobs currently running.
Each job's bar is read from the `status.json` that job writes.
The iterator's bar, at the top, counts jobs: its percentage
is how many of the batch have finished.

The bars use tqdm and are shown only when stderr is a terminal.

Independently of the bar, every run writes `status.json` files into its work
directories, which another process can follow at any time.


### Debug output

simnexus logs through the standard `logging` module, one logger per module
under the `simnexus` name, so the usual configuration applies:

```python
import logging
logging.basicConfig( level=logging.DEBUG )                # everything

logging.basicConfig( level=logging.WARNING )              # or simnexus alone
logging.getLogger( 'simnexus' ).setLevel( logging.DEBUG )
```

The solvers' own output is not logged: it is redirected to files in the run
directory (`*.stdout`, `*.stderr`), and a job running in parallel writes what
it prints to `job_N/job.log` so it does not disturb the progress bars.


## Example problems
The `examples` directory holds runnable scripts, each demonstrating one part of
the workflow. Run them from the project root.

 - `dyna_spring.py` — an LS-DYNA workflow: the `*PARAMETER` values of a deck are
   set from the variables, the job is submitted, and nodal displacements and
   coordinates are read back from the d3plot.
 - `jinja_dyna.py` — an LS-DYNA deck parameterised with Jinja markup
   (`JinjaReplace`) instead of `*PARAMETER` cards, run through OpenRadioss with
   `RadiossUsingDynaInput`.
 - `radioss.py` — an OpenRadioss workflow: starter and engine decks, job
   submission, and results extraction from the d3plot it writes.
 - `openfoam_example.py` — an OpenFOAM workflow: mesh creation and solve
   (`blockMesh`, `icoFoam`), then extraction of a pressure field.
 - `discover_graph.py` — inspecting a graph before running it, with
   `parameters()` and `outputs()`. No solver needed.
 - `radioss_progress.py`, `radioss_progress_workarea.py`,
   `radioss_progress_nested.py` — the same OpenRadioss run, which solves and
   then reads its results back from VTK, in three shapes: as the progress bars
   of a parallel study, as one run in a `WorkArea` followed from its
   `status.json` with `StatusWatcher`, and as a study whose jobs each hold a
   `WorkArea` in a subdirectory. Needs OpenRadioss.
 - `parallel_jobs.py` — a design study run with `solve_parallel`: the same six
   design points one at a time and then three at a time, with the timings, the
   job bar, and the `job_N` directories it leaves behind. No solver needed.
 - `remote/` — remote execution over gRPC: a self-contained client and server in
   one script (`remote_execution.py`), and an OpenFOAM server in a container
   (`openfoam_remote_server.py`, `openfoam_remote_example.py`,
   `Dockerfile.openfoam`). See `remote/README.md`.

The LS-DYNA, OpenRadioss and OpenFOAM examples follow the same pattern, so an
example written for one solver is easy to move to another. The decks they use
are in `tests` and `models`; the solver itself has to be installed and on the
path.
