class DirectedGraph(WorkAction, Observer):
    
    """
    A directed graph used to determine the order of evaluation and
    dependencies.

    Used e.g. for MDO for solvers run in parallel.

    A graph will append any computed results to
    val_dict and return that. 
    So A.solve( {'v1':1.2} ) may return {'v1':1.2, 'A':3.4},
    where the 'A':3.4 was added with 'A' the name of the action.

    Arguments:
        name (str) : name of the graph; must be a valid Python identifier.
        asynch (bool) : run the children of *this* graph concurrently.
            Every child whose parents have finished is started at once, in
            a child process (there is no limit on how many run together);
            the default False evaluates them one after the other. The flag
            belongs to this graph only: it is not inherited, so a graph
            nested in an ``asynch`` graph runs its own children serially
            unless it also sets ``asynch=True``, and it parallelises the
            actions of one design point, never the jobs of a
            ``SimulationIterator``. Three consequences of running in
            another process: the children's results travel back through a
            ``multiprocessing.Manager`` dict and so must be picklable; the
            children inherit this graph's working directory and therefore
            all run in it, so branches that write files need a ``WorkArea``
            each (or distinct file names) to avoid overwriting one another;
            and a child that raises, dies or returns nothing terminates its
            running siblings and raises ``AsyncActionError``. The child is
            forked where the platform has fork and spawned otherwise
            (Windows, see ``simnexus.util.parallel``); spawning also
            requires the *action itself* to be picklable, with its class
            in an importable module rather than in the calling script,
            which the child does not re-import.
        work_area_path (str) : run the graph in this directory instead of
            the current one, by wrapping it in a ``WorkArea``.
        cleanup (Cleanup) : only meaningful together with
            ``work_area_path``; passed to the work area it creates.
