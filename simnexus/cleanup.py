"""
Removing bulk solver output from run directories after a graph has run.

A design study keeps every job directory, and solver field output (d3plot
files, OpenRadioss animation files, VTK directories) is what fills a disk.
The policy for removing it is a :class:`simnexus.args.Cleanup`, passed as
the ``cleanup`` argument of a ``WorkArea`` or a ``SimulationIterator``.

The split of responsibility is deliberate:

* the *actions* know which of their files are bulk output -- they declare
  it through ``WorkAction._disposable_files()``, and the user can subtract
  from that per action with ``DynaAnalysis( ..., keep=['d3plot'] )``;
* the *work areas* know *when* deleting is safe -- only once the whole
  graph has run, so a d3plot reader downstream of the solver has already
  read what it needed, and never for a job that failed, whose deck and log
  are what you need to debug it.

This module holds the walk that turns an action tree plus a policy into a
per-directory delete plan, and the code that applies it.

    Work out what to delete, per directory, for an action subtree.

    Walks the action tree from ``action``, tracking the directory each
    action runs in: a nested ``WorkArea`` moves its children into its own
    subdirectory, so its solver's files are found there rather than in the
    parent's directory. A nested work area that carries its own ``cleanup``
    overrides the inherited policy for its subtree; a nested
    ``SimulationIterator`` is skipped, since it cleans its own job
    directories as it runs them.

    Arguments:
        action (WorkAction) : root of the subtree to clean.
