class Cleanup:
    """
    Policy for removing files from a run directory once the graph has run.

    A study that keeps every solver's field output fills a disk quickly.
    Pass a ``Cleanup`` as the ``cleanup`` argument of ``WorkArea`` or
    ``SimulationIterator`` to have the bulky files removed after the run,
    keeping the ones you still want.

    The actions themselves declare which of their files are bulk output
    (``WorkAction._disposable_files()``), so ``remove`` normally needs no
    file names: ``keep`` subtracts from what those declarations select.

    Arguments:
        remove : what is eligible for deletion.

            * ``Cleanup.BULK`` (``'bulk'``, the default) -- the field
              output the actions declare as disposable (d3plot files,
              OpenRadioss animation files, VTK directories, ...). Decks,
              logs and small history files are not touched.
            * ``Cleanup.ALL`` (``'*'``) -- everything in the run
              directories except the protected files and ``keep``. A job
              directory also holds files nothing declared (copied-in
              inputs, solver scratch), so this deletes more than simnexus
              knows about; use it deliberately.
            * a list of glob patterns (or a single pattern string) --
              exactly those, in every run directory.
        keep (list) : glob patterns that are never deleted. Always wins
            over ``remove``. E.g. ``keep=['d3plot']`` drops the state
            files but leaves the first plot behind.
        dry_run (bool) : log what would be deleted and delete nothing.
            Worth doing once for a new ``remove='*'`` policy.

        SimulationIterator( graph, cleanup=Cleanup( keep=['d3plot'] ) )
