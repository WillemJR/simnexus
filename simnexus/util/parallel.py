"""
Choosing the multiprocessing start method simnexus runs child processes
with, and starting them so that the calling script is left alone.

Two places in simnexus run work in a child process: a ``SimulationIterator``
with ``max_workers`` > 1 (a process per job) and an ``asynch``
``DirectedGraph`` (a process per action). Both used to ask for ``fork``
explicitly, which exists only on POSIX -- on Windows the request fell
through to ``spawn`` and the run then died at ``Process.start()``, because
under ``spawn`` the target callable and its arguments must be *pickled* to
reach a fresh interpreter and both call sites passed a closure.

The workers are module-level functions now and the objects they carry
(actions, graphs, the iterator, ``StatusReporter``) know how to pickle
themselves, so both start methods work. ``fork`` stays the preference where
it exists: it is cheaper, it needs nothing to be picklable, and the child
inherits the parent's imports, logging configuration and working directory.
``spawn`` is the fallback -- on Windows because there is nothing else, and
on Python 3.14, where ``fork`` is no longer the default on Linux either.

**A spawned child does not re-import the calling script.** Stock
``multiprocessing`` makes a spawned child run the ``__main__`` module
again (as ``__mp_main__``) so that objects pickled by reference to it can
be found -- so the script's top-level code runs once more in every child,
and a script that starts the run at top level starts it again there
(multiprocessing raises a RuntimeError about bootstrapping). simnexus does
not need the script in the child: the workers live in simnexus modules and
the graph travels as a pickle. So ``start_process`` hides ``__main__``'s
``__spec__`` and ``__file__`` from multiprocessing while it collects what
the child is told to import, and the child comes up without touching the
script, which runs once, as written.

The one thing that then cannot travel is an object pickled *by reference
to the script* -- an action class (or a function) defined in the script
itself, since the child has no ``__main__`` to look it up in. ``start_process``
checks for that before starting the child and raises ``SpawnError`` naming
the offender: move it into a module the child can import. Setting
``IMPORT_MAIN`` (or ``SIMNEXUS_SPAWN_IMPORTS_MAIN=1``) restores
multiprocessing's behaviour instead, with what it implies for the script.

Set ``SIMNEXUS_START_METHOD`` (or ``simnexus.util.parallel.START_METHOD``)
to force one method -- useful to exercise the Windows path on Linux, or to
avoid ``fork`` in a process that has already started threads.
