"""
Design studies: evaluating a graph once per design point, and finding
those results again afterwards.

``SimulationIterator`` runs the graph in a numbered job directory per
design point. ``JobIndex`` indexes those directories, which is what makes
past runs retrievable: it maps each job to the variable values it was run
with and to the group labels it carries.

The two belong in one module because they describe the same thing from
two sides - the iterator writes the results directory, the index reads it
- and because the index means nothing without the layout the iterator
creates.

Each design evaluation writes its variable values to
``iter_variables.json`` and its action outputs to ``actions_output.pkl``
inside its own ``job_N`` directory. Those files describe one job but say
nothing about the set: answering "which job used K=0.2?" or "which jobs
belong to the baseline study?" meant walking every directory and reading
every file.

``jobs_index.json`` at the results root records one entry per job::

    { "jobs": [ { "job": "job_0",
                  "groups": [ "baseline" ],
                  "variables": { "K": 0.2, "T": 75 },
                  "state": "done",
                  "created_at": 1753,  "updated_at": 1755 } ] }

The index is a *cache*, never the authority: ``JobIndex.rebuild`` derives
it from the job directories themselves, so result trees produced before
this file existed (and trees whose index was deleted) keep working. Only
the group labels are unique to the index - they are chosen by the caller
and cannot be recovered from the job directories - so a rebuild preserves
the labels of jobs it already knows.

Directory names stay ``job_0 ... job_N``. Encoding variable values in the
name would have to invent a float format, would break when a study adds a
variable, and could not express group membership at all.

class SimulationIterator(WorkAction):
    """
    Used to evaluate different designs in different directories.
    It calls the graph in different subdirectories -- a subdirectory per design.
    Use WorkArea to overwrite the results in a directory.

    This is designed as a top-level action.

    Every job is recorded in a ``jobs_index.json`` at the results root
    (see ``JobIndex`` in this module), which maps the job directories to the
    variable values they were run with and to the group labels they carry.
    That index backs the retrieval methods (``find_jobs``, ``results_for``,
    ``collect``) and ``reuse_existing``, and can be rebuilt from the job
    directories at any time.

    An existing results directory is added to: jobs are numbered after the
    ones already there, so a study can be extended in a later session and
    a finished job is never written over. Pass ``clean_start=True`` to
    delete the results directory first.

    args:
        graph (DirectedGraph) : DirectedGraph or WorkFlow
        parameter_list (list) : Only needed to provided default values to eval. Maybe not needed.
        work_area_path (str) : Default is to ./{graph.name}
        copy_paths (list) :
        clean_start (bool) : delete the results directory (jobs, index and
            all) before starting.
        cleanup (Cleanup) : remove bulk solver output from each job
            directory once that job's graph has run, so a long study does
            not fill the disk with field output. See
            :class:`simnexus.args.Cleanup`; ``True`` selects the default
            policy, ``None`` (the default) keeps every file. A job that
            failed is never cleaned -- its deck and solver log are what you
            debug it with -- and neither are ``actions_output.pkl``,
            ``iter_variables.json`` or the index, so ``results_for``,
            ``collect`` and ``reuse_existing`` keep working on a cleaned
            study. A ``WorkArea`` nested in the graph inherits this policy
            unless it sets its own.
        groups (str|list) : default group label(s) for the jobs this
            iterator runs. Overridden per call by the ``groups`` argument
            of ``solve``/``collect_for_expdes``/``collect_for_varrange``,
            and settable at any time as ``iterator.groups``.
        reuse_existing (bool) : when True, a design point that already has
            a completed job in the results directory is not run again: its
            stored outputs are returned instead. Default False, which runs
            every design point given, whether or not an equivalent job is
            already there.
        max_workers (int) : how many jobs of a sweep may run at the same
            time, each in a child process of its own (forked where the
            platform has fork, spawned on Windows -- see
            ``simnexus.util.parallel``). The default 1 runs
            them one after the other. Only the sweep methods
            (``collect_for_expdes``, ``collect_for_varrange``) fan out;
            ``solve`` is one design point and always runs here. This
            process stays the only one that allocates job directories and
            writes the index, so the numbering cannot race, and a child
            leaves its results in its own job directory, where they are
            read back once it exits -- so the results are structured
            exactly as in a serial run. A job that fails aborts the sweep,
            as it does when running serially: the jobs still running are
            terminated and ``AsyncActionError`` is raised with the child's
            traceback. Set it no higher than the machine can run solvers:
            each job is a full graph, and a solver action may itself use
            several cores (and an ``asynch`` graph several processes).
            On a platform without fork (Windows) the child is a fresh
            interpreter, so the graph and its actions must be picklable
            and action classes must live in an importable module rather
            than in the calling script (``SpawnError`` otherwise); the
            child does not re-import the script.

    Returns:
        dict: Output from graph (it adds nothing).

        Evaluate a batch of design points ``max_workers`` at a time, one
        child process per job -- the plural of ``solve``, which evaluates
        one design point here in this process.

        Used by ``collect_for_expdes``, and directly when the design points
        come from something that hands them out in batches (a generation of
        an optimizer, say) and the outputs are wanted as they are, without
        the design matrix ``collect_for_expdes`` builds.

        A child runs the graph in the directory handed to it and leaves its
        results there (``actions_output.pkl``); this process reads them back
        once the child has exited, so nothing has to survive a pipe and the
        results are structured exactly as in a serial run. Job directories
        and the index stay the business of this process alone.

        A job that fails aborts the batch, as it does when the sweep runs
        serially: the jobs still running are terminated -- their results
        could not be used anyway -- marked failed in the index, and
        ``AsyncActionError`` is raised carrying the child's traceback. The
        jobs that finished keep their results, so the batch can be resumed
        with ``reuse_existing=True``.

        The children are forked where the platform has fork and spawned
        otherwise (Windows); ``simnexus.util.parallel`` chooses. Spawning
        costs the graph having to be picklable -- with its action classes
        in an importable module, since the child does not re-import the
        calling script -- but the sweep is otherwise the same either way.

        Args:
            design_points (list) : one ``{variable name: value}`` dict per
                design point, as ``solve`` takes for a single one. Missing
                parameters are filled in with their default values.
            groups (str|list) : group label(s) for these jobs, overriding
                the iterator's default.
            progress_bar (bool) : report progress as ``tqdm`` bars on
                stderr: one counting the jobs of the batch, and under it a
                bar per job running right now, fed from that job's
                ``status.json`` so it follows the job's actions and a
                solver's percent-complete. The default None shows them when
                tqdm is installed and stderr is a terminal; True insists
                (and warns when tqdm is missing), False never shows them.
                The bars are a convenience for a terminal:
                ``status.json`` is written whichever way this is set.
