"""
Progress reporting for long-running workflows.

Status is exchanged between the workflow process and consumers (e.g. a GUI
running as a separate process) through small ``status.json`` files written
into the work directories -- the same channel already used for
``iter_variables.json`` and ``actions_output.pkl``. Files are written
atomically (temp file + ``os.replace``), so a reader never sees a
half-written file, and either side can start, stop or crash independently.

Writer side (used internally by ``DirectedGraph`` and
``SimulationIterator``):

* ``StatusReporter`` -- owns the ``status.json`` of one directory, writes
  it on every state change, and keeps a heartbeat timestamp fresh from a
  daemon thread so a reader can tell a slow run from a dead one.
* ``MultiReporter`` -- reports to several of those at once, which is how
  a graph inside a ``WorkArea`` fills both the work area's own file and
  the file of the graph that encloses it.

Reader side (for the GUI):

* ``StatusWatcher`` -- cheap mtime-based polling of one status file.
* ``RunWatcher`` -- follows a ``SimulationIterator`` results tree: the root
  status plus the job(s) running now.
* ``watch_run()`` -- blocking generator over ``RunWatcher`` for scripts;
  GUIs with an event loop should call ``RunWatcher.poll()`` from a timer
  instead.
* ``is_alive()`` -- heartbeat-based liveness check of a status dict.
* ``job_fraction()`` -- one job's overall progress, averaged over its
  actions, for a caller that wants a single number (a progress bar).

Status file schema (a graph's file; the iterator's root file has
``jobs_total``/``jobs_done``/``current_job``/``current_jobs`` instead of
``actions`` -- ``current_jobs`` lists the jobs running at this moment,
more than one when the iterator runs with ``max_workers`` > 1, while
``current_job`` names the last job started and is kept for readers that
follow a single job)::

    {
      "name": "Radioss_WorkFlow",
      "state": "running",              # pending|running|idle|done|failed
      "pid": 12345,
      "heartbeat_interval": 5.0,
      "started_at": 1751871242.1,      # epoch seconds
      "updated_at": 1751880093.7,
      "actions": {
        "jinja_prep": {"state": "done",    "fraction": null, "message": null},
        "rad_solver": {"state": "running", "fraction": null, "message": null}
      }
    }

The ``fraction`` and ``message`` fields carry an action's own
percent-complete: solver actions fill them from their stdout files, and an
action of your own does so with ``self.report_progress(...)``. They stay
``null`` for an action that does not report, or whose output cannot be
parsed.

class StatusReporter:
    """
    Writes the ``status.json`` of one directory.

    Used by ``DirectedGraph.solve`` (per-action states, in the run
    directory) and ``SimulationIterator.solve`` (job counts, at the results
    root). A write happens on every state change; between changes a daemon
    thread rewrites the file every ``heartbeat_interval`` seconds so
    ``updated_at`` stays fresh while the process is alive.

    Reporting must never break a workflow: write errors are logged and
    swallowed, and a reporter for a directory that is already owned by
    another reporter in this process silently becomes a no-op.

    **Fork safety (asynch actions).** An asynch action runs ``solve()`` in
    a forked child process holding a copy of this reporter. A child never
    touches ``status.json`` (two processes rewriting one file would race)
    and never uses the inherited lock (which may have been copied in a
    locked state): ``action_state`` detects the pid change and writes the
    single entry to a per-action sidecar file
    (``.<action>.progress.json``) instead. The owning process folds
    sidecars into ``status.json`` on every write and every heartbeat, so
    child fractions surface at heartbeat cadence, and deletes them when
    the action reaches a terminal state (or at ``finish``).

    Arguments:
        name (str) : name of the graph/iterator this status describes.

    the latest time with ``parse_time`` (see

    header), pass ``t_end=None`` and a ``find_t_end`` callable; the thread
    reads the *head* of the file each poll until it can extract ``t_end``,
    then reports normally. (It reads the head, not the tail, because such a
